\begin{problems}
\problem A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be nowhere dense if $\mathrm{Int}\; \overline{A} = \emptyset$.
\begin{subproblems}
\item Let $U$ be an open subset of a topological space. Prove that $\partial U$ is closed and nowhere dense.
\item Let $V$ be a closed and nowhere dense set. Show that $V$ is the boundary of an open set.
\end{subproblems}


\problem Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous maps from a topological space $X$ to a Hausdorff
space $Y$.  Suppose $f=g$ on a dense subset of $X$. Prove that $f=g$. 

\problem {\color{blue} Exercise 4.38}
%Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint compact subsets
%of a Hausdorff space.  Show that there are disjoint open sets $U_A$
%and $U_B$ with $A\subset U_A$ and $B \subset U_B$.

\problem Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are spaces and $Y$ is compact.
Show that the projection $X\times Y \to Y$ is a closed map.

\problem Let $G$ be an algebraic group.  We say that $G$ is a {\bf topological group}
if in addition $G$ is a topological space
such that that the multiplication
map $m:G\times G\ra G$ and the inversion map $i:G\ra G$ defined by $m(g,h)=g\cdot h$ and $i(g)=g^{-1}$
are continuous.
\begin{subproblems}
\item
Suppose $G$ is an algebraic group and a $T_1$ topological space.  Show that $G$ is a 
topological group if and only if the map $f:G\times G\ra G$ defined by $f(g,h)=g h^{-1}$
is continuous.
\item Let $G$ be a topological group and let $H$ be a subgroup.  Show that $\overline H$ is
a subgroup.  Hint: that map $f$ from the previous part is continuous.

% \problem Consider the set $\Reals^\omega$. Let $\ell^2$ be the subset of $\Reals^\omega$
% of square summable sequences.  That is, $(x_1,x_2,\ldots)\in \ell^2$ if $x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots$ is finite.
% We can put a metric on $\ell^2$ by $d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2+\cdots}$ You
% do {\bf NOT} need to verify that this is a metric.  We take the topology on $\ell^2$
% to be the topology generated by this metric.

% Determine if the embedding of $\ell^2\hookrightarrow \Reals^\omega$ is continuous if
% $\Reals^\omega$ is given
% \begin{subproblems}
%   \item the product topology, or
%   \item the box topology.
% \end{subproblems}

\problem Let $\{x_n\}_n$ be a sequence in an arbitrary
product $\prod X_\alpha$. Show that $x_n\to x$ if 
and only if $\pi_\alpha(x_n)\to \pi_\alpha(x)$ for every $\alpha$.
Then show that this result is false if we assume
instead that $\prod X_\alpha$ is given the box topology.

\problem Let $X$ be a topological space.  The {\bf suspension} of $X$, denoted by
$\Sigma X$, is the quotient of $X\times [-1,1]$ where all points of the form $(x,1)$
are identified, and all points of the form $(x,-1)$ are identified.  
Determine, with proof, a familiar space that is homeomorphic to $\Sigma S^n$.

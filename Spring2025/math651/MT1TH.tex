\begin{problems}
\problem Suppose $q: X\to Y$ is a quotient map and that each fiber of $q$ is connected.
Show that if $Y$ is connected, then so is $X$.

\problem A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be nowhere dense if $\mathrm{Int}\; \overline{A} = \emptyset$.
\begin{subproblems}
\item Let $U$ be an open subset of a topological space. Prove that $\partial U$ is closed and nowhere dense.
\item Let $V$ be a closed and nowhere dense set. Show that $V$ is the boundary of an open set.
\end{subproblems}


\problem Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous maps from a topological space $X$ to a Hausdorff
space $Y$.  Suppose $f=g$ on a dense subset of $X$. Prove that $f=g$.

\problem Let $G$ be an algebraic group.  We say that $G$ is a {\bf topological group}
if in addition $G$ is a topological space
such that that the multiplication
map $m:G\times G\ra G$ and the inversion map $i:G\ra G$ defined by $m(g,h)=g\cdot h$ and $i(g)=g^{-1}$
are continuous.
\begin{subproblems}
\item
Suppose $G$ is an algebraic group and a topological space.  Show that $G$ is a 
topological group if and only if the map $f:G\times G\ra G$ defined by $f(g,h)=g h^{-1}$
is continuous.
\item Let $G$ be a topological group and let $H$ be a subgroup.  Show that $\overline H$ is
a subgroup.  Hint: that map $f$ from the previous part is continuous. 

\end{subproblems}

\problem Suppose the spaces $X_\alpha$, $\alpha in I$ are all connected
and nonempty, and let $a$ be a point in $X=\prod_{\alpha in I} X_\alpha$.
\begin{subproblems}
\item Given any finite set $K\subset I$, let $X_K$ denote the subspace
of $X$ where $x_\alpha = a_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\not in K$.  Show that 
each $X_K$ is connected.
\item Show that $Y = \cup_{K} X_K$ is connected.
\item Show that $\overline Y = X$ and conclude that $X$ is connected.

    \problem
    Let $X$ be a topological space.  The {\bf suspension} of $X$, denoted by
    $\Sigma X$, is the quotient of $X\times [-1,1]$ where all points of the form $(x,1)$
    are identified, and all points of the form $(x,-1)$ are identified.  
    Determine, with proof, a familiar space that is homeomorphic to $\Sigma S^n$.

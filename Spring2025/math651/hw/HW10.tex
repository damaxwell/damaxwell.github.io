\problem 4-23 (a,b)

\problem The point of this exercise is to settle some details from the 
proof of the Brower fixed point theorem.  We suppose $f:\bbB\to \bbB$ is
continuous and that $f$ does not have a fixed point.
\begin{subproblems}
\item Prove that for all $x\in \bbB^2$ there exists a unique
$t(x)\in[1,\infty)$ such that $f(x)+t(x)(x-f(x))\in S^1$.
\item Define
\[
r(x) = f(x)+t(x)(x-f(x)),
\]
so $r:\bbB\to S^1$.  The graph of $r$ is a subset of $\bbB\times S^1$.  
We wish to show that $r$ is continuous, and since $S^1$ is compact and Hausdorff
it is enough to show that the graph of $r$ is closed.  Do so.  Hint:
Suppose $(x_n,r(x_n))\to (x,z)\in \bbB\times S^1$.  Now show that $z=r(x)$.
We'll discuss in the problem session what a boon the closed graph theorem is here.

\problem Crossley 6.6: Show that if $f, g: S^1\rightarrow S^1$ then $[f\circ g] = [g\circ f]$.

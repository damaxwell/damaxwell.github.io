\problem Prove that the exterior angles of a regular pentagon add to four right angles.

\problem Deduce the opposite angles of a rhombus (a paralellogram with equal sides) are equal.

\problem Here is a special case of Euclid's parallel postulate, which we will call the
\textbf{right triangle axiom}.

\textit{Given a right angle $ABD$ and an acute angle $\alpha = CAB$ on the same side of the line $AB$,
the ray $AC$ when extended will intersect the extension of ray $BD$.}

Show that the right triangle axiom is equivalent to Playfair's axiom. That is, show that Euclid Book I Postulates 1-4 together with the right triangle axiom imply Playfair's axiom, and that 
Book I Postulates 1-4 together with Playfair's axiom imply the right triangle axiom.

\problem For complex numbers $z_1=x_1+iy_1$ and $z_2=x_2+iy_2$, use a direct computation (without resort to polar coordinates) to show that $|z_1z_2|=|z_1||z_2|$.
You will probably find it easier to show
$|z_1z_2|^2=|z_1|^2|z_2|^2$, which is fine.

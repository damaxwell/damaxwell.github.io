### About me

{% capture include %}
Hi!

A long time ago I went to a university in southern Ontario and
became captivated by mathematics and physics; I have a BMath in Pure
and Applied Mathematics from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/).  After 
earning an MSc at [UBC](https://www.math.ubc.ca) 
in mathematical fluid dynamics I spent a short 
stint as a software developer during the "dot-com bubble" 
and returned to grad school at the [University of Washington](https://math.washington.edu).
In 2004 I received a PhD in Mathematics, moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, 
and seem to have not looked back.

My [research](research.html) is mostly in the realm of general relativity.
This was my thesis topic and I've returned to it after spending a number
of years also studying inverse problems in glaciology with 
[colleagues](https://www.uaf.edu/experts/martin-truffer.php) [at](https://bueler.github.io) UAF.

I spend a lot of time teaching engineering students at all levels.
My favorite teaching task these days is Applied Engineering Mathematics,
a preparatory course for  first-year engineering majors. 
It's based on the [Wright State Model](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/research/engineering-mathematics-topics-and-materials):
  * All-applied content, co-taught with the [College of Engineering and Mines](https://www.uaf.edu/cem/)
  * Hands-on labs, programming, and other fun bits

What else? Well, I like oranges. üçä A lot.

Oh, and sometimes I call [contra](https://contraborealis.org) and square dances.

Anyway, enjoy the site. Poke around. Maybe drop me a line. And have a nice day!

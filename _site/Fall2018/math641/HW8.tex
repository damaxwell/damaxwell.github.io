\hproblem [Mason] Suppose $f\in\Riem[a,b]$ and $\alpha\in\Reals$.  Show that $\alpha f\in\Riem[a,b]$ and
$$
\int_a^b \alpha f = \alpha \int_a^b f
$$

\hproblem [Sakti] Show that the uniform limit of Riemann integrable functions 
is Riemann integrable.  Conclude that $\Riem[a,b]$ is a closed
subset of $B[a,b]$.

\hproblem [Max] Find (with proof) an element of $\Riem[a,b]$ that is not a uniform limit of step functions.
  
\hproblem [Jody] Show that integration on $\Riem[a,b]$ (as a closed subset
of $B[a,b]$ is continuous by showing that the map
$$
f\mapsto \int_a^b f
$$
is a bounded linear map.

\hproblem [Lander] Determine if $\chi_\Delta\in \Riem[0,1]$,
where $\Delta$ is the Cantor set.

\hproblem [Jody] Suppose $l:{\mathcal P}(\Reals)\ra [0,\infty]$
and that it is either additive or that it is countably additive.
Show that either $l(\emptyset)=0$ or $l(A)=\infty$ for all $A\in\mathcal P(\Reals)$.  Regardless, show that $l$ is monotone.

\hproblem [Mason] Suppose $l:{\mathcal P}(\Reals)\ra [0,\infty]$.
Show that $l$ is countably additive
if and only if $l$ is finitely additive and countably
subadditive.

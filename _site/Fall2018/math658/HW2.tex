\hproblem [Polarization Identity]
Let $x\cdot y$ denote the standard dot product in $\Reals^n$ where $n=2$ or $n=3$.
and let $|x|$ denote the length of $x$, so
\begin{equation}
|x| = \sqrt{x\cdot x}.
\end{equation}
Show that for all $x,y\in \Reals^n$,
\begin{equation}
x\cdot y = \frac{1}{2}\left[ |x+y|^2-|x|^2 - |y|^2\right].
\end{equation}
This formula is known as the polarization identity, and it shows that if you
can compute lengths, then you can also compute the dot product.

\hproblem [Symmetric bilinear maps are determined by their action on the diagonal] 
A map $B:\Reals^3\times \Reals^3\ra \Reals$ is called symmetric
if $B(x,y)=B(y,x)$ for all $x,y\in \Reals^3$.  We say $B$ is linear in its
first argument if $B(x+z,y)=B(x,y)+B(z,y)$ for all $x,y,z$ and if $B(\lambda x,y)=\lambda B(x,y)$
for all $\lambda\in\Reals$ and all $x,y\in \Reals^3$.  The definition for $B$ 
being linear with respect to its second argument is similar, and we say
that $B$ is \textbf{bilinear} if it is linear with respect to both arguments.
Suppose $B$ and $\hat B$ are both bilinear and symmetric, and that for all $x\in \Reals^3$,
\begin{equation}
B(x,x) = \hat B(x,x).
\end{equation}
Show that $B(x,y)=\hat B(x,y)$ for all $x,y\in\Reals^3$.

Hint: Try out that polarization trick.

\hproblem  In this problem you may assume that every isometry of $\Reals^3$ that
sends the origin to itself is a linear map (i.e. there is a $3\times 3$
matrix $A$ such that $i(x)= Ax$).  Under this assumption (which is true!), show 
that a map $i:\Reals^3\ra \Reals^3$ is an isometry if and only if there is a matrix
$A$ such that $A^t A=I$ and a vector $b$ such that
\begin{equation}
i(x) = Ax + b.
\end{equation}
Hint: Preserving distance is the same as preserving distance squared!  
And think about polarization.

\hproblem Suppose that $A\in O(3)$.  Show that $A\in SO(3)$ if and only if
for all vectors $x,y,z\in \Reals^3$ such that $(0,x,y,z)$ is positively oriented,
so is $(0,Ax, Ay, Az)$.

Bonus:  Show that if for for just one positively oriented $(0,x,y,z)$ we know that
$(0, Ax, Ay, Az)$, show that we can still conclude that $A\in SO(3)$.

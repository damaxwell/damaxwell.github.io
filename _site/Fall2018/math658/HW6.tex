\begin{subproblems}
\item Let $\xi\in\Reals^3$, let $z\in\Cplx$ and let $u(t,x)=ze^{i(\xi\cdot x - c|\xi|t) )}$.
Show that $u$ is a complex valued solution of the wave equation.  Describe its
real part as a wave.  What is the speed of the wave? What direction is it travelling in? What is
its frequency?
\item Let $\hat f:\Reals^3\ra \Cplx$ be smooth and compactly supported (i.e., $f(\xi)=0$ for $\xi$
outside of some large ball). Show that
$$
U(t,x)=\int_{\Reals^3} \hat f(\xi) e^{i(\xi\cdot x - c|\xi|t) )} d\xi
$$
is a complex-valued solution of the wave equation (and hence its real and imaginary parts
both solve the wave equation).  How is the solution $U$ related to the kinds of solutions
described in part a)?
\item
Show that
\begin{equation}
u(t,x) = U(t,x) + U(-t,x)
\end{equation}
solves the wave equation with $u_t(0,x)=0$.
\item A result from Fourier analysis says that if $f:\Reals^3\ra \Cplx$
is, say, continuous and
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Reals^3} |f|^2
\end{equation}
is finite, then
\begin{equation}
f(x) =  \int_{\Reals^3} \hat f(\xi) e^{i\xi\cdot x } d\xi
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\hat f(\xi) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int_{\Reals^3} f(x) e^{-i\xi\cdot x } dx.
\end{equation}
With this result in hand, describe a strategy for solving the initial value problem
\begin{align*}
u_{tt}-c^2\Delta u &= 0\\
u(0,x) &= \phi(x)\\
u_t(0,x) &= 0.
\end{align*}
\item Challenge: describe a strategy for solving the initial value problem
\begin{align*}
u_{tt}-c^2\Delta u &= 0\\
u(0,x) &= 0\\
u_t(0,x) &= \psi.
\end{align*}
What new issues appear compared to part \emph{d}?

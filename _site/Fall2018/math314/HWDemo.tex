\begin{document}

\begin{exercise}{1.1}
Describe all vectors $\mathbf w = (w_1,w_2)$ that are perpendicular
to $\mathbf v = (2,-1)$.
\end{exercise}
\solution
The vectors are perpendicular if $\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf w = 0$.
That is, we require
\[
2w_1-w_2=0
\]
or equivalently, $w_2 = 2w_1$.  Hence 
\[
\mathbf w = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 2a \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $a$ is a real number.

\begin{exercise}{1.2}
Use Octave to plot $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ for $-\pi \le x \le \pi$ on the same graph.
Make sure the graph is labeled nicely.
\end{exercise}
\solution
\begin{verbatim}
octave:1> x=[-pi:0.01:pi];
octave:2> plot(x,sin(x),x,cos(x));
octave:3> set(gca, "fontsize", 14 )

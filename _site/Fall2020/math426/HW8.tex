\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 1}
Finish your code from question 19 of the worksheet on implementing
LU decomposition with partial pivoting.  Then use this code together
with the course page \texttt{lsolve} and your own \texttt{usolve}
to solve $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ where
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 3 & 2 & 0 &7 \\
7 & 6 & 9 & 6 & 4\\
2 & 7 & 7 & 8 & 2 \\
0 & 9 & 7 & 2 & 2 \\
7 & 3 & 6 & 4 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and $b=[35,58,53,37,39]^T$.  For the record, the true solution is $x=[0,1,2,3,4]^T$.

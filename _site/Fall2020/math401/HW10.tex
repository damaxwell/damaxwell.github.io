\begin{exercise}{Abbott 4.5.5 (b)}

You may assume that you have found a sequence of nested intervals $I_k=[a_k,b_k]$ with $f(a_)<0$ and $f(b_k)\ge 0$ and $|I_{k+1}|=|I_k|_/2$,
where $|\cdot|$ denotes the length of the interval.

For those of you in Numerical Analysis, this proof of the IVT 
mirrors the bisection method for finding roots!

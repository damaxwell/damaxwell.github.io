\begin{document}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 1} 
Suppose $(a_n)\to a$ and $a\neq 0$.
Show that there exists $N\in \Nats$
such that if $n\ge N$, then $a_n\neq 0$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 2}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
Show that if $a,b\ge 0$  and $a>b$,
then $\sqrt{a}>\sqrt{b}$.
\item Exercise 2.3.1(a)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{2.3.3}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{2.3.10} For full credit, all arguments should be short!
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 3}
Show that if $|b_n|\to 0$, then $b_n\to 0$.
Then show that this statement is false if we replace $0$
with any other real number.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{2.3.10 (c)}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2$. 
Give a careful proof by induction that the partial sums
\[
s_k = \sum_{n=1}^k 1/n^2
\]
satisfy $s_k < 2 - 1/k$.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 1}
Let
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}  
1 & -1 & 0 & \alpha-\beta & \beta\\
0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}; \qquad \vb = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\0\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}
\]
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Show that that for any choice of numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, 
the solution of $A\vx=\vb = (1,1,1,1,1)^T$.
\item This is an upper triangular matrix!  
For $\alpha= 0.1$ and $\beta=10^1,10^2,\ldots,10^{12}$ solve
$A\vx=\vb$ using your {\tt usolve} code.  
Present a table of $||\vx-\hat \vx ||_\infty$
\item  Present a table of the $\infty$ norm condition numbers 
of the matrices $A$ from the previous problem.
\item Discuss the relationship between parts (b) and (c).
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 2}
Suppose you have data points $(1,y_1),\ldots, (n,y_n)$
and that the points $(k,\log(y_k))$ all lie on a line with
positive slope. Show that there are constants $C>0$ and $\alpha>1$
such that
\[
y_k = C \alpha^k
\]
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 3}
We will shortly be seeing the Vandermonde matrices,
which show up when doing polynomial interpolation.
So, they appear naturally in the real world, and
the point of this exercise is to characterize just
how awfully their condition number grows as the
size of the matrix grows.

Given a vector $\vx=(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)^T$, the
$(n+1)\times (n+1)$ Vandermode matrix associated
with $\vx$ is defined on page 181 in your text.
You can create one in matlab with the command {\tt vander(x)}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $n=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $20$, let $\vx=(0,1/n,2/n,\ldots, 1)$,
and let $\kappa_n$ be the 2-norm condition number of the
Vandermonde matrix associated with $\vx$.  Make
a plot of $\log(\kappa_n)$ versus $n$.
\item If everything has gone well, your plot will look like a straight line!  Use a least squares method to find $m$ and $b$ such that
\[
\log(\kappa_n) \approx m n + b
\]
Then plot your line on the same graph as in part (b).

For full credit, you must show the matlab commands used to
obtain $m$ and $b$.
\item Find constants $C$ and $\alpha$ such that
\[
\kappa_n \approx C \alpha^n
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

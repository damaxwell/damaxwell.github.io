   start writing up your own solutions.
   If it works for you, you should be able to make a PDF file like [this.](HW1-Template.pdf)  Notice that it looks suspiciously like your first homework. &#128521;

*  Here is [a beginner's guide to LaTeX](BeginningLatex.pdf).  Please read it, even if you have used LaTeX before.

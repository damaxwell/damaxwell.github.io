\begin{exercise}{Abbott 4.3.9}\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Show that a continuous function on all of $\Reals$ that equals zero
on the rational numbers must be the zero function
\item Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two continuous functions on the real
numbers. Is it true that if $f(q)=g(q)$ for all $q\in\Rats$, then $f$ and $g$
are the same function?
\end{enumerate}	
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 2}
 Suppose $K\subseteq \Reals$ is compact.  Show that
there exists $x_M\in K$ such that $x_M\ge x$ for all $x\in K$.  Then,
with very little work, show that there exists $x_m\in K$ such
that $x_m \le x$ for all $x\in K$.

\begin{document}


\begin{exercise}{1.4.7} Finish the proof of Theorem 1.4.5 by
showing that the assumption $\alpha^2>2$ contradicts the
assumption that $\alpha=\sup A$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 1} Give a from-scratch
proof of the following facts:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item If $f:A\to B$ has an inverse function $g$, then
$f$ is injective.
\item If $f:A\to B$ has an inverse function $g$, then
$f$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Proof (a)]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof (b)]
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 2} Show that the sets $[0,1)$ and $(0,1)$ have the same cardinality.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{1.5.10 (a) (c)}
(Wait until after Wednesday to start this one)
\begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
	
\item Let $C\subseteq[0,1]$ be uncountable.  Show that
there exists $a\in(0,1)$ such that $C\cap [a,1]$ is uncountable.
\item[(c)] Determine, with proof, if the same statement remains
true replacing uncountable with infinite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Proof (a)]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof (b)]
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 3}
(Wait until after Wednesday to start this one)
Suppose for each $k\in\Nats$ that $A_k$ is at most countable.
Use the fact that $\Nats\times\Nats$ is countably infinite to
show that $\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k$ is at most countable.  Hint:
take advantage of surjections.
\end{exercise}

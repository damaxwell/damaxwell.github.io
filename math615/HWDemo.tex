\begin{exercise}{1.2.5}
Use the triangle inequality to establish the following inequalities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
\[
|a-b| \le |a| + |b|,
\]
\item[(b)] 
\[
||a|-|b|| \le |a-b|.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Part (a).]
From the triangle inequality,
\[
|a-b| \le |a| + |-b| = |a| + |b|.
\]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Part (b).]
First, we apply the triange inequality to observe
\[
|a| = |a-b + b| \le |a-b| + |b|.
\]
Hence
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tri1}
|a|-|b| \le |a-b|.
\end{equation}
On the other hand another application of the triangle inequality implies
\[
|b| = |b-a + a| \le |b-a| + |a| = |a-b| + |a|.
\]
Hence
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tri2}
|b| - |a| \le |a-b|.
\end{equation}
Combining equations \eqref{eq:tri1} and \eqref{eq:tri2} we find
\[
-|a-b| \le |a|-|b| \le |a-b|
\]
which is equivalent to
\[
||a|-|b|| \le |a-b|
\]
\end{proof}

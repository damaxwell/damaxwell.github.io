\problem Suppose this table of ``data'' is samples of an 
$O(h^p)$ function:

\hfil\begin{tabular}{c|l|l|l|l|l|l}
 h  & 1.0 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.05 & 0.01 & 0.005 \\\hline
Z & 56.859  & 21.694 & 1.1081 & 1.1101 & 0.096909 & 0.011051
\end{tabular}

This data may be fitted (linear regression) by a function 
$f(h) = M h^p$ for some values $M$ and $p$, as in the following figure.
Find $p$ by fitting a straight line to the data, and reproduce the figure. Your version of the figure should have the value of $p$ filled in.

\problem Use Taylor's Theorem to verify the truncation term
for the ``Centered'' row of Table 1.1 of your text.  Hint:
center all Taylor expansions at the same point. 

Substantial partial
credit will be awarded for showing the truncation
term is $O(h^2)$, but try to get the exact expression with its
constant. Hint: The average of two numbers lies in between the two
numbers.

\problem Implement the following schemes for
a scalar ODE:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Forward Euler
	\item Backwards Euler
	\item Trapezodial
\end{enumerate}
Each method should be implemented with a function
that takes the following arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The right-hand side function $f(t,u)$.
	\item The initial time $t_0$.
	\item The initial value $u_0$.
	\item The final time $T$.
	\item The number $M$ of time steps.
\end{enumerate}
It should return a vector of sample times $t_k$, 
and a vector of solution values $u_k$.

Test your methods against $u'=-u$ and $u'=-\sin(t)$
with initial condition $u(0)=1$ and confirm (using the technique
of problem 1) that 
the order of convergence is the theoretically expected order
for each method.

\problem Consider the linear multistep method
\[
u_{n+2} +4 u_{n+1} -5u_{n} = h(4f_{n+1}+2f_n)
\]
where $f_k=f(t_k,u_k)$. 
\begin{subproblems}
\item Show that this method is consistent.
\item In the case $f=0$, the method reduces to
a linear recurrence relation
\[
u_{n+2} +4 u_{n+1} -5u_{n} = 0.
\]
The characteristic polynomial of this relation is
$\sigma(\rho) = \rho^2+4\rho -5$.  Show that if
$\rho$ is a root of the characteristic polynomial, then
$u_n = C\rho^n$ is a solution of the recurrence relation
for any constant $C$. Moreover, if $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$
are roots of the characteristic polynomial, then
$u_n=C_1\rho_1^n + C_2\rho_2^n$ is a solution of the
recurrence relation for any constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.
\item Compute the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
\item Implement this method (using Euler's method 
to compute $u_1$) and apply it to the IVP
\begin{align*}
u'&=-u\\
u(0)&=1
\end{align*}
on the $t$-interval $[0,1]$ with $M=10$, $50$ and $100$.
\item Compute the global error in each of these three cases.
Why is the error growing?  Can you give an rough explanation
for the rate of growth you observed?
